            I initially started my career as an engineering intern at a
            telecommunications company, collecting and analyzing data to improve
            employee experience. In the meantime, I was running a personal
            trainer side business that I had started during college.

            After completing my internship, I decided to work full-time on my
            entrepreneurial pursuit to expand the business. During this
            experience, I discovered two passions â€” helping people and tech.
            First, it was very fulfilling to see how we were able to change a
            lot of people's lives. And second, as part of this business, I
            helped create an app for my clients, which sparked a high interest
            in tech.

            }}

            Following these two interests, I decided to move to NY to pursue a
            career in tech. I started by learning English and then pursuing a
            Master's in Information Experience Design. Through this program, I
            deepened my design and coding skills and had the opportunity to work
            on interesting projects that proved that tech is a field I will
            succeed in.
